              <strong>
                What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              While I feel I learned a ton in our first in-person sprint week, I
              absolutely felt held back at times. When it comes down to being
              held back, I mostly feel it's just a plain lack of syntax
              knowledge which will come with experience. I was excited for the
              Mind Reader project after pseudocoding everything, reading the
              documentation, and having my plan of attack on building a JSON
              file to pull data from. That was until I hit a huge wall. I made
              it through building my JSON file and pulling some of the data, but
              I could not for the life of me figure out how to correctly pull
              data from my fetch into a function to where I could switch my data
              for each card. I had asked some questions and got some help, but
              after we reached the end of the day, I went home still not
              successfully understanding how to pull the data and pretty much
              nuked my progress and threw my code in the javascript graveyard. I
              started from scratch and went with a new plan. While my new plan
              and code worked, it was not how I wanted to create my project and
              I think stinted potential learning. I later found out on demo day
              I was incredibly close to success with my first bit of code when I
              gave up. Had I asked one more question, a last plea for help, I
              would've been able to break through that wall. At the end of the
              day I held myself back because I was afraid of asking for help
              again and became impatient. But I've now learned something,
              something I can build on and not make that mistake again. Better
              to learn this earlier than later!
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding
                JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              For me, I really want to learn more and more JavaScript. I find
              JSON and API's somewhat fascinating in being able to grab data and
              produce it into something useful. It's also where I have found I
              have struggled the most with in a couple projects I've now worked
              on. I'm hoping I will soon break through my barrier with those
              two!

              <strong>
                How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoyed being in person more than I thought I would to be
              honest. Remote onboarding felt like just doing the homework you
              were given and sort of being on your own. While I work well on my
              own, being in the presence of other students and our instructors
              who are motivated to accomplish this bootcamp together has given
              me more motivation. Everyone in our group has been incredibly
              welcoming, open, and helpful so far. I feel like we are coming
              together quickly and working well as a team already. In a way, it
              already kind of feels like a family in a sense. We are all wanting
              to change something in our lives, to something greater, and are
              holding each other accountable to be the best we can be. I am very
              much looking forward to sharing our struggles, our successes, our
              laughs, and our cries together along the way.{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What is your “Why”?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              I am here in the bootcamp because I felt it's where I needed to
              be. I needed to do something new. Something difficult. Something
              creative. I have always struggled with stagnation and hit a point
              in my life/career where I felt I needed a new challenge to set me
              in a different direction. I was looking for a new journey and
              thanks to a good friend, I was pushed towards web development and
              programming. I have always been intrigued with it and always
              wanted to understand the magic of it all. My true "Why?" is that I
              don't have another option I would feel comfortable falling back
              on. It's uncomfortable, but I kind of jumped off the cliff and
              planned to learn to fly on the way down. I did the same thing when
              I decided I was going to try to race cars professionally. I made
              the leap and gave myself no other option than to dedicate myself
              to becoming just that and I did it. I've learned that I have to
              jump all the way in to something or I won't learn, I won't be
              successful. I've now given myself no other option than to learn,
              be a good developer, a great one even, because I cannot stand only
              being statisfactory.

            Blog #3: It’s All Coming Together (2/11/22)
          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            <p>
              Week three is done and dusted. A bit more work than the first two
              and the first time pulling an entire project together using HTML,
              CSS, and Javascript without any hand holding. Our task was to
              build a simple alarm clock which was a little nerve wracking at
              first, but after moving through things piece by piece and finally
              getting items to work, it was also the most gratifying week so
              far.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’ve worked on HTML, CSS, and Javascript mostly on their own with
              little crossover, but never altogether at once. This blog, while
              written in markdown, populates in HTML with a hint of CSS and
              allows me to convey a story, pictures, or maybe even a GIF or two.
              Working through all three elements though, you start to see how
              many different options there are to produce the same results. HTML
              being more of your basic formatting like trying to put the edges
              of a puzzle together first, CSS is putting what pieces you can
              together to look like the picture, and finally placing all the
              pieces neatly together with Javascript to complete the whole
              puzzle. Javascript continues to baffle me in how powerful and
              intricate it can be. It’s really the motor behind everything and
              provides a lot of the user interactivity where you can create or
              modify designs, make calculations, kick off events, sounds, you
              name it, it can do it. I take a liking to CSS since I enjoy the
              design side of things. Every website or app I use, I pay close
              attention to how it feels and works from a user standpoint. Does
              it catch the eye? Is it easy to navigate? Does it pull me in to
              want to use the site?
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of the day, I’m simply impressed at all of the
              different paths to a destination and how much of an art
              programming can be. I’m just excited to dive deeper into it and
              see where the journey takes me.

              <strong>
                What is something you wish you could do but currently do not
                have the coding skills to accomplish?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              While I know we have not touched on it much yet, Javascript. I
              feel I understand HTML and CSS enough to be able to navigate my
              way through creating something that looks reasonably well, but I
              am really wanting to bring more function into what I can make with
              HTML and CSS.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What are you struggling with?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              In terms of the work we have been given so far, I don't feel
              there's anything I'm struggling with yet. There have been some
              additional small projects I am trying to work on in addition where
              you essentially need to create a project from scratch. Something
              like a Frontend Mentor challenge where you have an end result they
              provide you with and maybe some basic code, but you have to create
              that small project from scratch and figure out how to build it
              effectively and efficiently. Since there is no specific way to get
              to the end result, sometimes I don't feel like I know where to
              start and when/where to add the pieces needed. I imagine this
              comes with experience and figuring out your preferred workflow.

              <strong>How do you solve a problem?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              When it comes to programming, I typically try a couple solutions I
              know off the top of my head to see if it changes/fixes the problem
              or at least helps me understand my problem better. Then I can
              narrow down the keywords I'm looking for or the exact problem in
              order to effectively research my problem. I try to read or watch a
              few different solutions and find something that I understand best
              and follow to resolve my problem. Maybe I take something that
              already works to test it, modify it, break it, whatever helps me
              better understand how something actually functions.
            </p>

              <strong>
                What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Often times going back to the beginning and reviewing everything
              I've just done step by step just to see if there's something small
              that I've missed or skipped. Far too many times there's something
              incredibly small that was looked over causing me to get stuck.
              I'll also just go occupy my time with something else to take a
              break from my issue since I've found myself thinking or staring at
              an issue for too long that I just can't figure out. Taking a step
              back and going into it again with a fresh mind seems to do the
              trick. My all time favorite, reverse engineering. I feel like
              there's so much to learn from taking something you know works and
              just looking at how all the pieces go together and understanding
              WHY they go together. If all else fails, I'm going to someone who
              knows more than I do!
